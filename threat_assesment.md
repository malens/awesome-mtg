This is somewhat of a meat and bones topic for a primer. It involves a large amount of threat assessment, table feel and knowledge of your deck and what possible decks your opponents will have. As you gain more information regarding what you are playing against you should be able to piece together a general idea of what strategy your opponents are pushing. Are they a combo deck? What sort of combo? [Aetherflux Reservoir](https://tappedout.net/mtg-card/aetherflux-reservoir/)? [Laboratory Maniac](https://tappedout.net/mtg-card/laboratory-maniac/)? [Necrotic Ooze](https://tappedout.net/mtg-card/necrotic-ooze/)? All of these decks interact with other decks differently and you have to be aware of how they execute their game plan. Choosing what to interact with and when to pull the trigger on a piece of removal or counter magic is crucially important to learning how to play a control deck. One thing that sets this style of play apart from Stax style control decks is that we do not actively prevent people from casting spells on a regular basis. We let the vast majority of spells go through or leave them to be dealt with by our other opponents. We pick and choose exactly what we interact with so as to keep everyone at bay. It is a tenuous balance and takes consistent reevaluation at almost every turn. To assist with this I personally work through a series of questions while analysing how I want to interact with a spell that is being cast.

### Do I care about it?

This is the first question to ask. They are trying to win and everything they do will be pushing towards that game plan. The first thing to consider is how does this affect you and your board state. Is it a mana rock? That really doesn’t affect you or your resources, you don’t care about it from a territorial perspective. If it does affect our resources we need to carefully weigh whether the loss of resources is worth the expenditure. Sometimes our loss is far less than another’s and we are willing to take the hit in order to take another player down a rung. In other situations it is our board that is being hit the hardest and we need to protect our lead. There is a careful balance, the big thing of note is that we have to build our advantage slowly. Other decks are able to deploy their wins at the drop of a hat and we need to be very cautious about spending too many resources protecting things that in the end will not win us the game.

### Is this a Threat? Does this affect my victory or my resources?

The big thing to think of here is, does this actively prevent us from winning the game or executing our game plan. The big things, for us and Tasigur's game plan, are persistent graveyard hate, persistent mana denial, or overwhelming card disadvantage - an opponent drawing too many cards or us losing too many cards. Unless it will immediately fizzle a combo player, we rarely interact with a tutor as it is not the spell that is affecting us, it is resources that our opponents are spending that we do not need to interact with.

### Does this threat need to be dealt with?

When we have identified that a spell or permanent is a threat we then need to identify if it needs to be dealt with or lived with. Several threats we can ignore as they either do not affect us as much as other players at the table. We need to identify who all is affected by the current threat. Is it just us? Are others more or less affected by the current threat? If we feel that it is hurting other more than us, can we live with it? There are very few pieces of hate that we actively need to answer, so usually we like stax elements on the table. If we have determined that we need to deal with something we then have to figure out who needs to deal with it and when.

### Who deals with this threat?

If it has to be answered on the stack, what is the priority order? Are we before or after the other blue players in the priority order? If there is no other Blue player behind you, most likely you will need to answer this on the stack. If there are other blue players behind you, will they see this as a big enough threat to deal with it? Do they have the resources to deal with it? Have they used any interaction recently? How much mana do they have? If they haven’t interacted much and have open mana, passing priority to them may force them to deal with this threat for you. It’s free resources to you. However, a Tasigur activation to get some interaction may be in order first. Even if you don’t have mana to use it after activating Tasigur.

### Do I need to Deal with this?

This is a very situational decision. Your main goal is to fizzle combo players, to keep stax elements at just barely bearable for you but unbearable for everyone else, and to have card and or mana advantage on other control decks. You also want to wait as long as possible to expend resources. If the threat is encroaching on those goals, it is getting on the priority list for things to deal with.

### Do I deal with it Now or Later?

Does this threat need to be answered on the Stack or on the Battlefield? If on the battlefield, do we care if it sits around for a while?

### Is this the right opportunity?

This is looking at the table position. Is this spell going to win the game for a player, but if I counter it, will just let another player win before I untap? Can we look at an alternative way to interact here? Is this player the one right before your turn? Be aware of what the table situation is and make other aware of it too. The longer the stalemate goes the better off we are. The stalemates give us more time to accumulate resources and more time for our value engines to run. If it isn’t a stab at breaking the stalemate we probably should let it be.

### How do I deal with it?

We have multitude of ways to deal with things. Counterspells, Targeted Removal, Mass Removal, Player Removal, and Creature Beats. We want to reserve Counterspells for the game winning threats - those that we cannot let resolve. Targeted Removal we prioritize on high value creatures and stax elements. Mass removal we have to use sparingly. As we are trying to lengthen the game, we end up with a rather large board presence compared to most other competitive decks. Player Removal is not to be scoffed at. Choosing who to attack with Tasigur and sticking to a single target until they are gone is surprisingly effective. Applying pressure on their life totals reduces the effectiveness of Necropotence, Sylvan Library, and Ad Nauseam. Additionally, Tasigur is much larger than most creatures that see play in Competitive EDH, this leads to chump blocks and free creature removal.#### [What to interact with - A Brief discussion of threat assessment](https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/tasigur-seasons-past-season-pastigur/#collapse-3DQJCD-38)
